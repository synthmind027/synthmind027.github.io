		<h3>Zen</h3>
		<code>
			Simple is the best.<br>
			Do not make useless thing.<br>
			There is no shorcut. Work hard.<br>
			In the end, the tool must be disassembled.<br>
			<br>
			All problems are illusions and mental illnesses.<br>
			Control and solution don't truly exist.<br>
			Only humans can make imaginary efforts to solve them.<br>
			<br>
			Do not optimize prematurely.<br>
			In most case, perfection does not need to be reached:<br>
			It is enough to simply deal with the problem when it arises.<br>
			<br>
			Constant cutting matters.<br>
			Trust saves a lot of costs.<br>
			Two-path self-consistency fills the blanks.<br>
			Remember logN, N, 2N: branch, data, linkage<br>
			Make data for convenient at the time of use.<br>
